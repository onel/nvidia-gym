# Task Verification

**Goal**: Understand what task verification is and how rewards drive model training.

## What is Verification?

Every resource server in NeMo Gym implements a `verify()` function that returns a reward value for task performance.

**The Problem**: When you ran the weather example in the quickstart, the agent successfully called the tool and provided a response. But was that response *good*? Should the model be rewarded or penalized? Without verification, you cannot measure performance or guide improvement.

**The Solution**: Each resource server must define exactly what "good performance" means for its domain.

## Why Verification Matters

**Tool Execution ≠ Good Performance**

- The right tool call was issued, e.g., `get_weather("San Francisco")`
- But was helpful advice given? Was the response accurate? Was it efficient?
- Verification answers these questions with numerical scores

**Training Signal**

Verification scores become the **reward signals** that drive reinforcement learning:
- High scores → "Do more of this behavior"  
- Low scores → "Avoid this behavior"
- No verification = No way to improve the model

## Common Verification Patterns

Let's look at real examples from NeMo Gym's resource servers:

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} Correctness Verification

**Simple Correctness** (`mcqa` - Multiple Choice Questions):
```python
# Extract model answer (A, B, C, or D)
pred = extract_answer_from_response(response)
gold = expected_answer  # e.g., "C"

# Binary scoring: right or wrong
is_correct = (pred == gold)
reward = 1.0 if is_correct else 0.0
```

**Sophisticated Correctness** (`math_with_judge` - Math Problems):
```python
# Uses math-verify library for mathematical equivalence
library_reward = math_metric.compute(predicted_answer, expected_answer)

# PLUS an LLM judge for edge cases
judge_prompt = f"Are these answers equivalent? {predicted_answer} vs {expected_answer}"
judge_score = await llm_judge(judge_prompt)

# Combines both signals
final_reward = combine_scores(library_reward, judge_score)
```

:::{tab-item} Quality Verification

**Instruction Following** (`instruction_following`):
```python
# Check if response follows specific instructions
instructions = ["Use exactly 3 sentences", "Include the word 'banana'", "End with a question"]
follow_list = []

for instruction in instructions:
    follows = instruction_checker.verify(model_response, instruction)
    follow_list.append(follows)

# Only reward if ALL instructions followed
reward = 1.0 if all(follow_list) else 0.0
```

:::

:::{tab-item} Efficiency Verification

**Tool Usage Patterns**:
```python
# Count unnecessary tool calls
tool_calls = count_tool_calls(model_response)
expected_calls = 1  # Should only need one weather call

# Penalize inefficiency  
efficiency_score = 1.0 - abs(tool_calls - expected_calls) * 0.2
reward = max(0.0, efficiency_score)
```

**Response Length**:
```python
# Prefer concise but complete responses
response_length = len(model_response.split())
optimal_length = 50  # words

if response_length <= optimal_length:
    reward = 1.0
else:
    # Penalize verbosity
    reward = max(0.5, 1.0 - (response_length - optimal_length) * 0.01)
```

## From Verification to Training

### **How Rewards Drive Learning**

1. Model generates response → Gets verification score
2. RL algorithm uses score to update model parameters  
3. Higher-scoring behaviors become more likely
4. Lower-scoring behaviors become less likely
5. Model improves over many training iterations

### **What Makes Good Verification**

**Reliable**: Same response should get same score consistently
```python
# Good: Deterministic scoring
reward = 1.0 if predicted_answer == expected_answer else 0.0

# Bad: Random or inconsistent scoring  
reward = random.uniform(0.8, 1.0) if correct else random.uniform(0.0, 0.2)
```

**Meaningful**: Scores should reflect actual task performance
```python
# Good: Measures what you care about
reward = accuracy_score + helpfulness_score + efficiency_score

# Bad: Measures irrelevant details
reward = 1.0 if response.startswith("Hello") else 0.0
```

**Scalable**: Can handle thousands of evaluations per second during training
```python
# Good: Fast, local computation
reward = simple_string_match(predicted, expected)

# Bad: Expensive API calls for every verification
reward = await expensive_api_call(predicted, expected)
```
